        <h1>Hola! Welcome to Danny's Portfolio!</h1>
        <p>
          As a software engineer, I am passionate about building projects that make a difference in my community.
          One of my key projects, <strong>Citizenship Readiness</strong>, is a full-stack application designed to help 
          individuals prepare for the U.S. civics test in both English and Spanish, supporting those who may face language barriers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past year, I have expanded my expertise by earning certifications in <strong>Fundamentals of Open Source IT and Cloud Computing</strong>
          from The Linux Foundation, as well as LinkedIn certifications in <strong>Cybersecurity Foundations, JavaScript, and IT Security</strong>.
          Additionally, I completed the University of Helsinkiâ€™s <strong>Full-Stack Open curriculum</strong> to further strengthen my technical skills.
