          <p>
            As a software engineer, I am passionate about building projects that make a difference in my community.
            One of my key projects, Citizenship Readiness, is a full-stack application designed to help 
            individuals prepare for the U.S. civics test in both English and Spanish, supporting those who may face language barriers.

            Over the past year, I have expanded my expertise by earning certifications in Fundamentals of Open Source IT and Cloud Computing
            from The Linux Foundation, as well as LinkedIn certifications in Cybersecurity Foundations, JavaScript, and IT Security.
            Additionally, I completed the University of Helsinkiâ€™s Full-Stack Open curriculum to further strengthen my technical skills.
