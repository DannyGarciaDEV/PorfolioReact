   I’m a full-stack developer trained at Resilient Coders, with hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express. I’ve worked on multiple projects that focused on clean code, responsive design, documentation, and problem-solving. My adaptability and ability to learn quickly helped me succeed, particularly during tough economic times.


   I’ve earned certifications in Open Source IT, Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity Foundations, and IT Security. I also completed the University of Helsinki’s full-stack open curriculum, focusing on React, Jest, and Cypress for testing.


   I bring a mix of technical expertise and leadership experience, having worked on a geothermal energy project at National Grid, where I developed an AI-driven chatbot. I received the "Find a Better Way" Award for my innovative contributions. I also worked with Transform Power Systems to build a website for Solar Forms.


   As a member of the Boston leadership team at Out in Tech, I organize events and workshops to foster an inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ tech professionals. <br></br>
